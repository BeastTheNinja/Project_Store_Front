## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### Option 1: Simple File Opening
1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
3. **That's it!** The site will load and fetch products from the API

### Option 2: Development Server (Recommended)
1. **Install a live server** (VS Code Live Server extension, or any local server)
2. **Serve the project** from the root directory
3. **Open in browser** - you'll get live reload when you make changes

### For SCSS Development
If you want to modify the styles:
1. **Install Sass**: `npm install -g sass` or use VS Code SCSS compiler extension
2. **Watch for changes**: `sass --watch scss/main.scss:assets/css/main.css`
3. **Edit SCSS files** in the `scss/` directory

---

## 📖 Learning Path

### 🟢 Beginner Level
Start with these files to understand the basics:

1. **`index.html`** - See how the HTML structure is set up
2. **`assets/js/main.js`** - Understand how the app starts
3. **`scss/abstracts/_variables.scss`** - Learn about design systems
4. **`assets/js/components/ProductComponent.js`** - See how products are displayed

### 🟡 Intermediate Level
Once comfortable with basics, explore:

1. **`assets/js/view.js`** - Learn component coordination
2. **`assets/js/api.js`** - Understand API integration
3. **`scss/components/`** - Study component-based styling
4. **`assets/js/cart.js`** - Learn state management

### 🔴 Advanced Level
For deeper understanding:

1. **`assets/js/components/CheckoutComponent.js`** - Complex form handling
2. **Event system** - How components communicate
3. **SCSS architecture** - Advanced styling patterns
4. **Error handling** - Robust application design

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Used

### Component-Based Architecture
Each UI element is a separate, reusable component:
- 🧩 **Modular**: Each component handles one responsibility
- 🔄 **Reusable**: Components can be used in multiple places
- 🧪 **Testable**: Components can be tested independently

### Event-Driven Communication
Components communicate through custom events:
```javascript
// Component A sends an event
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('addToCart', { 
  detail: { productId: 123 } 
}));

// Component B listens for the event
window.addEventListener('addToCart', (event) => {
  // Handle the event
});
```

### SCSS 7-1 Architecture
Styles are organized into 7 folders + 1 main file:
- 📁 **abstracts/**: Variables, mixins, functions
- 📁 **base/**: Reset, typography, base HTML styles
- 📁 **components/**: Individual component styles
- 📁 **layout/**: Page layout (header, footer, grid)
- 📁 **pages/**: Page-specific styles
- 📁 **themes/**: Different color schemes
- 📁 **vendors/**: Third-party CSS
- 📄 **main.scss**: Imports everything in the right order
